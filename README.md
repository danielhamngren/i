# i

## Compile

Run `cargo build`

## Running (during development)

Run `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`

## Uploading files

Can be done using `curl`. The following command-line uploads a file `testfile.txt` in the current directory to the server.
A random filename will be generated by the server and returned in the JSON object, as well as in a `Location:` header (since the response will be a 303 See Other upon success)

```
$ curl -F file=@testfile.txt -F options='{"useOriginalFilename":false}' http://localhost:8088
```

The following example will upload the same file, but will use the original filename instead.

```
$ curl -F file=@testfile.txt -F options='{"useOriginalFilename":true}' http://localhost:8088
```

## Configuration

Set the following environmental variables to configure `i`.

* `I_BASE_DIR`: Set to the file system directory where uploaded files will be stored to and served from. Default `./tmp`.
* `I_PUBLIC_BASE`: Set to the complete server URL base which should be used when generating links. Default: `http://localhost:{I_PORT}`.
* `I_PORT`: Which port `i` should listen to. Default `8088`.
